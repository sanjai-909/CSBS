1)  Design a Web page with frameset concepts (or iframes):   Divide the page into two rows with 30% and 70% ratio.  
                     ------ The First row frame shows your name and your details.
                     --------The Second row frame further divided into two columns( 40%, 60%) 
                               First column holds your educational qualification as hyperlinked bulleted items. Every bulleted item should show a                                   separate HTML document in the second column (60% frame)
Note:  Apply all necessary attributes for the tags to improve look and feel of the page
2) Refer manual for second exercise

RUN ON VS CODE and submit xml documents and DTD file
Exercise
No.7:  XML document with validation using
internal and external Document Type Definition and transformation using XSLT


 


a)      Design an xml document with an
internal DTD for the following:


Create a root element as SASTRA, has a child
element “schools” which is the parent of elements “school”.  SOC, SOM & BL are the TEXT of each
“school”.  Value of an attribute
“category” of the first “school” element is “computing”.  Second “school” element contains the
following attributes (category=’management’, campus=’main’) and 3rd
‘school’ element consists the attributes (category=’law’, degree= either ‘ug’
or ‘pg’ but default is ‘ug’). 


b)      2.  Create an XML document and external DTD for
the following


Root <Software>.  Child tags <languages>,
<application> and <system>. 
Every child element should have minimum 1 child element for them with
meaningful attributes.  Document should
have at least one element with no. of occurrences is 2  and attributes with choice based values
required.


c)      Apply the basic styles of XSLT for the
“books.xml” document.  Transform the
content on the browser using the following styles: 


<xsl:for-each ..>                     


<xsl:sort .. >


<xsl:if..>


<xsl:choice ..>


<xsl:apply-templates..>


Note:  for the above ex no 3,
kindly refer the XML document from the following url: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yB6eNaxEtnzhHnEfJ8T6U_6shwlv0b4p/view?usp=sharing
