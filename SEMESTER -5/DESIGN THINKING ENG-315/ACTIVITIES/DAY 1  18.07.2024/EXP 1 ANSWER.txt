I find the arguments in this paper highly relevant to today's educational needs. This emphasis on developing 21st-century skills through constructivist learning is crucial. Traditional education often falls short in preparing us for real-world challenges, and the integration of Design Thinking seems like a promising approach to make learning more practical and holistic. Implementing such changes could make learning more engaging and meaningful for students like me.
