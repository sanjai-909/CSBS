This project focuses on developing and testing compliance software for greenhouse farmers in Argentina, driven by new regulations requiring good agricultural practices. The software aims to help farmers transition from intuition-based to evidence-based decision-making by tracking crop batches and treatments, reducing compliance risks. The project uses design-thinking to involve farmers in the development process, testing the effectiveness of the decision support system (DSS) in encouraging technology adoption and identifying barriers to its use.
