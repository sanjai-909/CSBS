The course at MIT D-Lab applies a human-centered design thinking approach to developing low-cost prosthetic and assistive devices for the developing world. Students from diverse backgrounds collaborate with international stakeholders and industry partners, learning the design process through interactive lectures and hands-on workshops. The course emphasizes real-world application by allowing students to test prototypes globally, leading to continued research, professional development, and project sustainability beyond the semester. The course's success has led to a tripling of student enrollment and a significant percentage of projects continuing after the class. This innovative educational model serves as a promising approach for development engineering courses, offering students impactful, career-enhancing learning experiences.
