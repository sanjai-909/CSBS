(intha stage la than members lam enna pannanum nu kathupanga aprm antha grp la irukura members kalam confusion ah irukum inga than avangalukula oru relationship ah build panna try pannuvanga)

trying to develop floor policies and relationship patterns among themselves

2.Storming:

Moreover as the problem festers , the job remains undone.
