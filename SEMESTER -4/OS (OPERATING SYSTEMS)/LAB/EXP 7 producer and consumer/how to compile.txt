By default, executable files are named a.out. To name the executable file something else, use the -o file_name option with the invocation command. This option creates an executable file with the name you specify as file_name. You can run the program by ./filename

gcc producer-consumer.c -o producer
gcc producer-consumer.c -o consumer

Terminal1
./producer

Terminal2
./consumer
